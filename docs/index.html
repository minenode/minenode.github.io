      <h2>MineNode is a <i>Minecraft: Java Edition</i> server built on top of Node.JS</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">A performant and easily modifiable Minecraft server, built from-scratch using TypeScript and Rust.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">Why Node.JS and Rust?</h3>
      <p class="subheading">
        Node.JS is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.JS uses libuv for its event loop, providing a performant, scalable and
        asynchronous I/O model. Combined with the V8 JavaScript engine, Node.JS is a blazing fast JavaScript runtime and a powerful platform for building fast
        and extensible applications. We use Node.JS for the core parts of MineNode, and we use Rust for other, more processor-intensive parts to make MineNode
        as fast as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="subheading">
        The use of Node.JS also presents an opportunity for developers to easily extend and modify MineNode using plugins written in JavaScript. This is an
        ideal scenario for plugins, especially when compared to, for example, the Java plugin system, which heavily relies on Reflection and other
        less-than-ideal techniques.
      </p>
      <p class="subheading">
        JavaScript is also more accessible to developers since it is a dynamic, interpreted language and does not require compilation. This makes it easier to
        write and debug plugins. Plugin developers will also be able to use the extensive NPM package registry to use third-party libraries.
      </p>
