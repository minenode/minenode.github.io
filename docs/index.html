      <h2>MineNode is a <i>Minecraft: Java Edition</i> server built on top of Node.JS</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Built from the ground-up as a performant and easily modifiable Minecraft server.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">Why Node.JS?</h3>
      <p class="subheading">
        Node.JS, combined with native C++ modules and TypeScript provide for a scalable and stable codebase while providing stable built-in standard library
        features for networking and other low-level abstraction.
      </p>
      <p class="subheading">
        The use of Node.JS also brings with it the opportunity for high-performance scripting for plugins, as well as allowing plugin developers to use the
        extensive NPM package collection.
      </p>
      <p class="subheading">C++ native modules are used to bring performance to CPU-intensive and low-level processes where needed.</p>
